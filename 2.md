# Kleene Closure/Positive is not the same as Fixed exoponent

**a<sup>+</sup>** and **a<sup>m</sup>** (where m > 0) are **different** in general.

Here's the explanation:

### 1. **a<sup>+</sup>** — *Kleene Positive*

* This means **"one or more occurrences"** of a.
* Formally:

  a<sup>+</sup> = \{ a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ....} 

* It includes all strings made by concatenating **at least one** a, any number of times.

### 2. **a<sup>m</sup>** — *Fixed Exponent*

* This is a **specific string** (or singleton set) with exactly **m** copies of a.
* For example, if m = 3, then:

  a<sup>m</sup> = aaa

### Summary of Difference:

| Expression | Meaning                        | Example if a = 'x', m = 3 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| a<sup>+</sup>    | One or more repetitions of a | {x, xx, xxx, xxxx, ...}       |
| a<sup>m</sup>    | Exactly $m$ repetitions of a | xxx                           |

So:

* **a<sup>m</sup> ⊂ a<sup>+</sup>** (because a<sup>m</sup> is one of the strings in a<sup>+</sup>)
* But they are **not equal**, unless you're talking about specific contexts where only strings of length m are valid.

## Complement of the language 

\{**ww ∣ w ∈ {a,b}<sup>*</sup>** } is indeed context-free.

### How?

- **A** generates odd-length strings whose **middle letter is \(a\)**.
- **B** generates odd-length strings whose **middle letter is \(b\)**.
- **S** generates:
  - Odd-length strings (via \(A\) or \(B\)),
  - Or concatenations of two odd-length strings with different middle letters (via \(AB\) or \(BA\)).

---

### Intuition about the complement of \( \{ ww \} \):

- All **odd-length strings** are in the complement since \(ww\) always has even length.
- For **even-length strings**, if \(x = uv\) where \(u, v\) have odd lengths and *different* middle letters, then \(x\) cannot be \(ww\).
- This means any string in the complement can be split into two parts \(u\) and \(v\) where \(u\) and \(v\) have different middle letters.
