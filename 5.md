# Tricky Language

\{ a<sup>n</sup> w a<sup>n</sup> | w ∈ {a,b}<sup>*</sup> } is a **regular** language

Naive Thinking (which is wrong) :  a is followed by w which is followed by equal no of a, hence CSL ❌


## Correct Approach

As w can be anything, we can make every language such that it starts with a and ends with a

Basically, fix a at start and at last, and then everything in between make that w

And a language which starts with a and ends with a is **Regular**


Similarly,

\{ w x w<sup>R</sup> | | w, x ∈ {a,b}<sup>*</sup>, |w|, |x| > 0 } is also **regular** ( Same Logic )

Since, w, x both can be anything, we simply make sure that the string just starts and ends with the same letter or not which again can be done using a finite automaton.
