### Notes:

* **DCFLs** are **not** closed under union, concatenation, or Kleene star.
* **DCFLs** *are* closed under **intersection with regular**, **complement**, and some other operations.
* **Recursive (Decidable)** languages are closed under all Boolean and language operations.
* **RE** languages are **not closed** under complement or difference, but are under most others.
