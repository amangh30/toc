# Chomsky Hierarchy

### **1. Type 0 â€“ Unrestricted Grammar (Recursively Enumerable Languages)**

* **Rules:** Î± â†’ Î²

  * Î±, Î²: Any string of terminals and non-terminals
  * Î± must contain at least one non-terminal
* **Machine:** Turing Machine
* **Power:** Most powerful (can simulate any computation)

---

### **2. Type 1 â€“ Context-Sensitive Grammar**

* **Rules:** Î±AÎ² â†’ Î±Î³Î²

  * A: Non-terminal
  * Î±, Î²: Strings (can be empty)
  * Î³: Non-empty string
  * **Length of RHS â‰¥ LHS**
* **Machine:** Linear Bounded Automaton
* **Note:** Context of A matters

---

### **3. Type 2 â€“ Context-Free Grammar**

* **Rules:** A â†’ Î³

  * A: Single non-terminal
  * Î³: Any string of terminals and non-terminals
* **Machine:** Pushdown Automaton
* **Common in:** Programming languages, parsers

---

### **4. Type 3 â€“ Regular Grammar**

* **Rules:** A â†’ aB or A â†’ a | A â†’ Ba or A â†’ a

  * A, B: Non-terminals
  * a: Terminal
  * Can be **right-linear** or **left-linear**
* **Machine:** Finite Automaton
* **Most restricted but efficient**

---

### **Exception in Type 1:**

* Normally, **Type 1 grammars do not allow shrinking rules**, i.e.,
  **|RHS| â‰¥ |LHS|** (length of right-hand side â‰¥ left-hand side).

* **Exception:** The rule **S â†’ Îµ** *(where S is the start symbol)* is allowed **only if** Îµ (the empty string) is in the language.

  **Conditions:**

  * S â†’ Îµ is allowed **only once**
  * **S must not appear on the RHS of any production**

---

This exception lets Type 1 grammars generate languages that include the empty string, which would otherwise violate the non-shrinking constraint.


---

### ðŸ’¬ What does **"S must not appear on the RHS of any production"** mean?

* **S** is the **start symbol**.
* **RHS** = Right-hand side of a production rule.

---

### âœ… Allowed:

If **S â†’ Îµ** is used (to allow the empty string in the language), then **S cannot appear on the right-hand side of any other rule.**

#### Example (Invalid):

```
S â†’ Îµ  
A â†’ aS  
```

ðŸš« **Invalid**, because **S appears on RHS of `A â†’ aS`**

#### Correct version:

```
S â†’ Îµ  
A â†’ aB  
```

âœ… Valid, because **S does not appear on the RHS**

---

### ðŸ”’ Why this restriction?

If **S** were allowed on the RHS while also producing Îµ, it could cause uncontrolled shrinking of strings, violating the **context-sensitive rule** that productions must not decrease length.

---

### **Distinguishable States:**

Two states are **distinguishable** if there exists **at least one input string** that leads to **different behavior** (e.g., one leads to an accepting state, the other doesnâ€™t).

---

### **Indistinguishable States:**

Two states are **indistinguishable** if **no input string** can tell them apart â€” they behave **identically** for all inputs.
