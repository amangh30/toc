# Countable & Uncountable

## **The set of all recursively enumerable languages is countable.**

This can be explained as follows:

A recursively enumerable (RE) language is one that can be recognized by a Turing machine. Since there are only countably many Turing machines (because each Turing machine can be encoded as a finite string over a finite alphabet), and each Turing machine defines at most one recursively enumerable language, the set of all RE languages is countable.

## **The set of all languages is uncountable**

The set of all possible languages over a given finite alphabet is **uncountable**. This is because a language is a set of strings, and the set of all strings over a finite alphabet is countable. However, the **power set** of a countable set (i.e., the set of all subsets of strings, which corresponds to all possible languages) is uncountable. Therefore, the set of all languages is uncountable.

## **The power set of a countably infinite set is uncountable**

For example, the set of all strings over a finite alphabet is countable, but the set of all languages (i.e., all subsets of strings) is its power set, which is uncountable.


because there is no one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the original set and its subsets. This was proven by Cantor’s diagonal argument, which shows that any attempt to list all subsets will always miss some—proving uncountability.
